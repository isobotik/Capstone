The obsolete information (columns) were removed and geospatial data were replaced by city center coordinates obtained from Foursquare (to be used in the visualization).\n",

    "The outcome can be used to address the problem and provide candidates for multi-sport event organization, but better results can be achieved if better data sources (instead of Foursquare) with less API limitations are used.\n",

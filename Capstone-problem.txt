The goal of my project is to address the following problem:

Classify large European cities based on their ability to host a multisport university event consisting of Football, Tennis and Ice Hockey.

Solution: Retrieve the list of largest European cities from Wikipedia and use Foursquare to get the numbers of Football, Hockey and Tennis stadiums near the city center. The use k-means clustering to split the cities to 4 groups based on results. Finally show the results on a map.

Data sources used: 
Wikipedia, Foursquare
